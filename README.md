# Steam Workshop Uploader

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/EliteMasterEric/SteamWorkshopUploader/blob/master/LICENSE.md)

A simple tool made in Godot. It helps you upload workshop items to any app on Steam. I made this because I was annoyed with the clunky tool I had to use for uploading mods for the Binding of Isaac.
